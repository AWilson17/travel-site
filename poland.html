<h1>Poland</h1>
<h2>Warsaw</h2>
<p>First stop, Warsaw, Poland. Poland is all about visiting Ann's extended family and taking in her heritage. Spending two and a half days expoloring some highlights including the Tomb of Unknown Soldier, Grand Opera, Parliament, Royal Lazienki Park, and Baroque Holy Cross Church, which houses an urn with the ashes of composer Frederick Chopin. The completely reconstructed Old Town boasts a number of historic monuments, art galleries, shops, charming restaurants, cafes, and craftsmen's workshops.</p>
