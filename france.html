<h2>France</h2>
<h3>Paris</h3>
<p>The romantic city of Paris is divided into the Right and Left Bank by the Seine River. Relatively compact for a capital city, you can easily explore most key sites by foot. The Île de la Cité is the historic center and features Notre Dame Cathedral and the Conciergerie, while Sainte Chapelle is nearby. The Left Bank features the Eiffel Tower, Latin Quarter, Sorbonne University, Luxembourg Gardens, and Saint Germain des Pres with its Romanesque Church, boutiques, and cafes. Highlights of the Right Bank include the Concorde Square, Arc de Triomphe, Opera House, and Louvre. Stroll along the impressive boulevards here for shopping, including the chic Champs Elysees with its designer shops and Boulevard Haussmann with its famous department stores. Above the city, charming Montmartre is home to the Moulin Rouge and Sacre-Coeur Basilica, while the Marais features 17th and 18th century town houses, trendy shops, and more.</p>
<p>This evening, you'll head to the pier at the foot of the Eiffel Tower to embark the 2 1/2 hour Bateaux Parisiens Dinner and Illuminations Cruise on the Seine River. A "smart dress code" is required for the cruise (no jeans, running shoes, etc.).</p>
<p>Begin boarding at 7:45 PM (cruise departs promptly at 8:30 PM) on this magical evening in the City of Lights, enjoying meticulously presented cuisine with attentive, discreet service. This voyage of discovery takes you through the majestic heart of Paris in a glass- covered boat. Dine on an all-inclusive menu, which features a choice of à-la-carte dishes: appetizer, starter, main dish, dessert, mineral waters, coffee and wines. Festive live music provides entertainment with the backdrop of one of the world's most romantic cities!</p>
